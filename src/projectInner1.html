        This module provides a series of articles that will help you master the essentials of web forms. Web forms are a
        very powerful tool for interacting with users â€” most commonly they are used for collecting data from users, or
        allowing them to control a user interface. However, for historical and technical reasons it's not always obvious
        how to use them to their full potential. We'll cover all the essential aspects of Web forms including marking up
        their HTML structure, styling form controls, validating form data, and submitting data to the server.
